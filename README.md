# Face recognition using OpenCV

this is a part of my 30 day journey to learn Artificial Intelligence by doing practical projects. On my 7th day I made this project.

If you are using any other external webCam, in main.py on line 5: cam = cv2.VideoCapture(0) change the value passed to VideoCapture from 0 to 1 or 2.
